### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mike

I am a data scientist in New York City who is always trying to learn new things and grow. I earned a PhD in Computational Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 where my research was the intersection of numerical analysis, high performance computing and renewable energy. Nowadays I am focusing on learning cutting edge techniques in big data and machine learning.

For over 17 years I was a competitive athlete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, during which I won the World Championships and achieved the rank of 1st degree Black Belt from 2x Pan American, Champion Professor Dave Ginsberg. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing coach along with great mentors, sponsors, friends, teammates and students.
