### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mike

I am an Applied Machine Learning Lead in New York City that is always trying to learn new things and grow. I earned a PhD in Computational Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> in 2016 where my research was the intersection of numerical analysis, high performance computing and renewable energy. In grad school I spent most of my time studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method">discontinuous Galerkin methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method">finite element methods</a> for simulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_cell">photo-electrochemical solar cells</a>. I was also a contributor to the C++ based finite element library <a href="https://www.dealii.org/">deal.ii</a>.

I tend to lean more towards to engineering side of data science and spend most of my time writing in Python, SQL, Scala & Bash. I am big fan of <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> and have been using it extensively since 2017. Now days I am focusing on my learning as much as I can about Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Cloud Computing.


### âš¡ Fun fact:

For over 17 years I was a competitive athlete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, during which I won the World Championships and achieved the rank of 1st degree Black Belt from 2x Pan American, Champion <a href="https://www.ginsbergacademy.com/">Professor Dave Ginsberg</a>. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing coach along with great mentors, sponsors, friends, teammates and students.
